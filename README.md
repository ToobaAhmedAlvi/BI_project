## ABOUT THE DATASET
- The Chinook dataset, a sample database mimicking a digital music store, offers numerous business use cases and problems to analyse. One common use case is understanding customer behaviour and preferences to improve sales strategies. 
- For example, businesses can analyse which genres are most popular, which customers purchase the most, and identify trends in customer purchasing habits. 
- This data can be used to optimize inventory, tailor marketing campaigns, and even personalize recommendations for customers.
